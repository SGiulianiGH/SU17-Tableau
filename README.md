# SU17-Tableau
Summer 2017 course: Introduction to Tableau

The purpose of this course was to learn the basics of Tableau. The course was condensed and therefore only a couple of assignments/exercises were required.

## Assignments

In this repository you will only see a few assignments since the course was shorter. The assignments typically included and exercise in Tableau with an accompanying report (all except 'assignment 2').

## Final Project

The final project was to replicate the Tableau Analytics and Visualization Challenge of 2017. The project is based on 3-year time series data including sampled stores and transaction information.

I created a number of individual charts/graphics, as well as a couple dashboards and a storyboard.
